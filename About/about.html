		Whom?
	</h1>
		<p>
			Hello. My name is Matt and I am learning to build websites. I am a Pisces, which perhaps means nothing, and I live in Hamtramck, Michigan.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order for you to learn a little bit more about me, I'm going to tell you THREE of my favorite things. 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Playing Music</li>
			<li>Hearing, reading, and watching good stories</li>
			<li>Goofing around on Twitter</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I am very excited that you are here, and I look forward to what the future will bring.
